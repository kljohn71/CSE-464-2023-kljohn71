This is the expected output text file. In this code, I have created my own Graph class to add and test the features. When downloaded, you just have to run mvn test to check the build. After, it will create an output_graph.png file as well as an output_graph.txt file that you can check, although the test cases should already be doing that.
The program will automatically check if there are a correct number of nodes in the case of the add nodes and add edge section of the code.

THis is the link to my previous commits for adding each feature and the test file

For Part 2, running mvn package will build again and test the code. There are 6 new test to look for, whcich are to remove 1 nodes, a set of nodes, and an edge, as well as a test for all 3 where there is no edge or node(s) found.
